One Game a Month project
------------------------

The [One Game a Month Project](http://www.onegameamonth.com) aims to get folk making games, NOT perfect games, but  workouts for the brain. Like a large scale CodingBat.

I plan to use this as a way of practicing the languages and frameworks I may need for my new job, HMTL5, css, java, javascript, php etc....
